# AI Generated Games

This project is a collection of two simple games generated by AI, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Bounce Game

The first game is called Wall Bounce, and it is a game where the user watches a ball bounce around a canvas and tries to predict which corner it will hit next. The corners are colored in green, red, blue, and yellow, and each corner corresponds to a score that is incremented whenever the ball hits that corner. The ball's movement is entirely random, and the user does not control its trajectory.

To play Wall Bounce, the user simply needs to click on the "Bounce Game" button on the homepage of the web application. The game will open on a new page, and the user can watch the ball bounce around and try to predict which corner it will hit next. Each time the ball hits a corner, the corresponding score will be incremented. The user can continue playing as long as they like, or they can navigate back to the homepage by clicking on the "Home" button at the bottom of the page.

## Match Game

The Match Game is a simple game where the player must match pairs of identical symbols hidden behind a grid of tiles. The player can click on two tiles to reveal what symbol is behind them. If the symbols match, the tiles will disappear, and the player earns points. If the symbols do not match, the tiles will flip back over, and the player must try again. The game ends when all pairs of symbols have been matched.

## How to Play

To play either game, simply click on the corresponding button on the AI Generated Games homepage. The Bounce Game will launch in a new window, and the Match Game will launch in a new tab. Follow the instructions on each game's screen to play.

Have fun playing!
