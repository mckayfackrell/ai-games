# AI Games

AI Games is a project that showcases the ability of AI to create playable games with just a few prompts. The games included in this project are DVD Corners, Hangman, Match, Pong, Snake, and Tic Tac Toe. Each game has its own set of instructions and gameplay mechanics that have been designed to be intuitive and easy to understand.

# Games

## DVD Corners
DVD Corners is a simple game where a DVD starts bouncing off the walls of a rectangular play area. You have to choose a corner that has a color and just see which one gets the most points. The longer you stay alive, the higher your score. The game ends when you hit the DVD or when you quit.

## Hangman
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. Each incorrect guess results in a penalty, such as the addition of a body part to a hangman figure. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when the hangman figure is fully formed.

## Match
Match is a color-based memory game where you are presented with a grid of cards, each with a different color on it. Your goal is to match pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time. The game ends when all pairs have been matched.

## Pong
Pong is a classic arcade game where you control a paddle that moves up and down on one side of the screen, trying to hit a ball that bounces back and forth between the two sides. The game ends when one player scores a certain number of points, typically 11 or 21.

## Snake
Snake is a classic arcade game where you control a snake that moves around a rectangular play area, trying to eat food while avoiding obstacles and its own tail. The snake grows longer each time it eats food, making it more difficult to avoid obstacles. The game ends when the snake collides with an obstacle or its own tail.

## Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid, trying to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player gets three in a row or when the grid is full and no more moves can be made.

# Usage

To play any of these games, simply run the corresponding file in your preferred environment (such as a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook) and follow the prompts. The games have been designed to be easy to play and understand, even if you have never played them before.

# Website

The AI Games website is live and can be accessed at [insert website URL here]. The website showcases the games included in this project and provides additional information about each one. Visitors can play the games directly on the website, making it easy to try them out and see for themselves how AI can create fun and engaging games.

# Conclusion

AI Games demonstrates the potential of AI to create fun and engaging games with minimal input from humans. Each game has been carefully crafted to be intuitive and enjoyable, providing hours of entertainment for players of all skill levels. Give them a try on the website or by running the files yourself, and see for yourself how AI can create games that are both challenging and rewarding.
